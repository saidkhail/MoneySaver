# MoneySaver

# Welcome to Money Saver Calulator!

This calulator essentially figures out how much money I need to save in years. This was inspired few years back thinking on how to save money to get a deposit for a property.
It is broken down into different segments i.e earning, current savings you have, expenditure and any discrentional spending. 
in addition to this it removes any interests.

# Improvements I'm thinking to do

1: Apply a Graphical User Intereface. I could use Tkinter to make it user friendly.

2: Include months and weeks if you are looking to save in a short time i.e holidays etc
